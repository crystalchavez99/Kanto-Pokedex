## PokeAPI
Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface access data related to Pok√©mon.

### Author's Note
This is my first web application using any API. Currently have no intention of making this a huge project, but a starting project to apply for my portfolio.
